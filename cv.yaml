about: '\vspace{18pt} \small{
  I research \textbf{data-driven decision making},
  including progressing \textbf{model-based reinforcmement learning} algorithms,
  applying them to real-world problems such as \textbf{robotics}, and planning for the \textbf{societal implications}
  of these technologies.}
