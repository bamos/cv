  Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been shown to be a powerful framework for data-efficiently learning control of continuous tasks. Recent work in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced function approximators and planning schemes, with little development of the general framework. In this paper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework--what we call the objective mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics model wrt the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control task. For example, this issue can emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate models might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of one-step ahead predictions is not always correlated with control performance. This observation highlights a critical limitation in the MBRL framework which will require further research to be fully understood and addressed. We propose an initial method to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics model training. Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential directions of research for addressing this issue.

  abstract={
    Model-based reinforcement learning is a compelling framework for
    data-efficient learning of agents that interact with
    the world. This family of algorithms has many
    subcomponents that need to be carefully selected and
    tuned. As a result the entry-bar for researchers to
    approach the field and to deploy it in real-world
    tasks can be daunting. In this paper, we present
    MBRL-Lib -- a machine learning library for
    model-based reinforcement learning in continuous
    state-action spaces based on PyTorch. MBRL-Lib is
    designed as a platform for both researchers, to
    easily develop, debug and compare new algorithms,
    and non-expert user, to lower the entry-bar of
    deploying state-of-the-art algorithms.
