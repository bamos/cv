  abstract={
Optimization is a ubiquitous modeling tool and is often deployed
in settings which repeatedly solve similar instances
of the same problem. Amortized optimization methods
use learning to predict the solutions to problems in
these settings, exploiting the shared structure
between similar problem instances. These methods
have been crucial in variational inference and
reinforcement learning and are capable of solving
optimization problems many orders of magnitudes
times faster than traditional optimization methods
that do not use amortization. This tutorial presents
an introduction to the amortized optimization
foundations behind these advancements and overviews
their applications in variational inference, sparse
coding, gradient-based meta-learning, control,
reinforcement learning, convex optimization, optimal

    This paper focuses on computing the convex conjugate operation that

    First-order methods are widely used to solve convex quadratic programs
    (QPs) in real-time applications because of their low
    per-iteration cost. However, they can suffer from
    slow convergence to accurate solutions. In this
    paper, we present a framework which learns an
    effective warm-start for a popular first-order
    method in real-time applications, Douglas-Rachford
    (DR) splitting, across a family of parametric
    QPs. This framework consists of two modules: a
    feedforward neural network block, which takes as
    input the parameters of the QP and outputs a
    warm-start, and a block which performs a fixed
    number of iterations of DR splitting from this
    warm-start and outputs a candidate solution. A key
    feature of our framework is its ability to do
    end-to-end learning as we differentiate through the
    DR iterations. To illustrate the effectiveness of
    our method, we provide generalization bounds (based
    on Rademacher complexity) that improve with the
    number of training problems and number of iterations
    simultaneously. We further apply our method to three
    real-time applications and observe that, by learning
    good warm-starts, we are able to significantly
    reduce the number of iterations required to obtain
    high-quality solutions.

Simulation-free methods for training continuous-time generative models
construct probability paths that go between noise

works, such as Flow Matching, derived paths that are
optimal for each data sample. However, these
algorithms rely on independent data and noise
samples, and do not exploit underlying structure in
the data distribution for constructing probability
paths. We propose Multisample Flow Matching, a more
general framework that uses non-trivial couplings
between data and noise samples while satisfying the
correct marginal constraints. At very small overhead
costs, this generalization allows us to (i) reduce
gradient variance during training, (ii) obtain
straighter flows for the learned vector field, which
allows us to generate high-quality samples using
fewer function evaluations, and (iii) obtain
transport maps with lower cost in high dimensions,
which has applications beyond generative
modeling. Importantly, we do so in a completely
simulation-free manner with a simple minimization
objective. We show that our proposed methods improve
sample consistency on downsampled ImageNet data
sets, and lead to better low-cost sample generation.

Natural agents can effectively learn from multiple data sources that

introducing a new, practically motivated
semi-supervised setting. Here, an agent has access
to two sets of trajectories: labelled trajectories
containing state, action, reward triplets at every
timestep, along with unlabelled trajectories that
contain only state and reward information. For this
setting, we develop a simple meta-algorithmic
pipeline that learns an inverse-dynamics model on
the labelled data to obtain proxy-labels for the
unlabelled data, followed by the use of any offline
RL algorithm on the true and proxy-labelled
trajectories. Empirically, we find this simple
pipeline to be highly successful -- on several D4RL
benchmarks, certain offline RL
algorithms can match the performance of variants
trained on a fully labeled dataset even when we
label only 10\% trajectories from the low return
regime. Finally, we perform a large-scale controlled
empirical study investigating the interplay of
data-centric properties of the labelled and
unlabelled datasets, with algorithmic design choices
(e.g., inverse dynamics, offline RL algorithm) to
identify general trends and best practices for
training RL agents on semi-supervised offline

Computational efforts in optimal transport traditionally

work, we choose to investigate the optimal transport
problem between probability measures when the
underlying metric space is non-Euclidean, or when
the cost function is understood to satisfy a least
action principle,also known as a Lagrangian
cost. These two generalizations are useful when
connecting observations from a physical system,
where the transport dynamics are influenced by the
geometry of the system, such as obstacles, and
allows practitioners to incorporate a priori
knowledge of the underlying system. Examples include
barriers for transport, or enforcing a certain
geometry, i.e., paths must be circular. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this formulation on
existing synthetic examples in the literature, where
we solve the optimal transport problems in the
absence of regularization, which is novel in the
literature. Our contributions are of computational

Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for four different control settings. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that is of independent interest, e.g., for generative modeling.}

    Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) are a class of generative models

    equation relating the log target probabilities and
    the CNF's defining vector field. PPD has several key
    benefits over existing methods: it sidesteps the

    to manifold data, scales to high dimensions, and is
    compatible with a large family of target paths
    interpolating pure noise and data in finite

    Mapping between discrete and continuous distributions is a difficult

    heuristical approaches. We propose a
    tessellation-based approach that directly learns
    quantization boundaries on a continuous space,
    complete with exact likelihood evaluations. This is
    done through constructing normalizing flows on
    convex polytopes parameterized through a
    differentiable Voronoi tessellation. Using a simple
    homeomorphism with an efficient log determinant
    Jacobian, we can then cheaply parameterize
    distributions on convex polytopes.

    We explore this approach in two application settings, mapping from
    discrete to continuous and vice versa. Firstly, a
    Voronoi dequantization allows automatically learning
    quantization boundaries in a multidimensional
    space. The location of boundaries and distances
    between regions can encode useful structural
    relations between the quantized discrete
    values. Secondly, a Voronoi mixture model has
    constant computation cost for likelihood evaluation
    regardless of the number of mixture
    components. Empirically, we show improvements over
    existing methods across a range of structured data

    poker. However, the search methods used in these
    games, and in many other settings, are
    tabular. Tabular search methods do not scale well
    with the size of the search space, and this problem
    is exacerbated by stochasticity and partial
    observability. In this work we replace tabular
    search with online model-based fine-tuning of a
    policy neural network via reinforcement learning,
    and show that this approach outperforms
    state-of-the-art search algorithms in benchmark
    settings. In particular, we use our search algorithm
    to achieve a new state-of-the-art result in
    self-play Hanabi, and show the generality of our
    algorithm by also showing that it outperforms
    tabular search in the Atari game Ms. Pacman.

        Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a useful method for aligning, comparing
        and combining time series, but it requires them to
        live in comparable spaces. In this work, we consider
        a setting in which time series live on different
        spaces without a sensible ground metric, causing DTW
        to become ill-defined. To alleviate this, we propose
        Gromov dynamic time warping (GDTW), a distance
        between time series on potentially incomparable
        spaces that avoids the comparability requirement by
        instead considering intra-relational geometry. We

        and comparing time series living on incomparable

        GDTW as a differentiable loss and assess its

    Training an agent to solve control tasks directly from
    high-dimensional images with model-free
    reinforcement learning (RL) has proven
    difficult. The agent needs to learn a latent
    representation together with a control policy to
    perform the task. Fitting a high-capacity encoder
    using a scarce reward signal is not only sample
    inefficient, but also prone to suboptimal
    convergence. Two ways to improve sample efficiency
    are to extract relevant features for the task and
    use off-policy algorithms. We dissect various
    approaches of learning good latent features, and
    conclude that the image reconstruction loss is the
    essential ingredient that enables efficient and
    stable representation learning in image-based
    RL. Following these findings, we devise an
    off-policy actor-critic algorithm with an auxiliary
    decoder that trains end-to-end and matches
    state-of-the-art performance across both model-free

        Multi-marginal optimal transport enables one to compare multiple

  abstract={
  Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been shown to be a powerful framework for data-efficiently learning control of continuous tasks. Recent work in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced function approximators and planning schemes, with little development of the general framework. In this paper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework--what we call the objective mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics model with respect to the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control task. For example, this issue can emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate models might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of one-step ahead predictions is not always correlated with control performance. This observation highlights a critical limitation in the MBRL framework which will require further research to be fully understood and addressed. We propose an initial method to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics model training. Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential directions of research for addressing this issue.

    Recent work has shown how to embed differentiable optimization problems (that is, problems whose solutions can be backpropagated through) as layers within deep learning architectures. This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver’s solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.

    We consider the setting of an agent with a fixed body interacting with an

    In spite of being trained with only internally available

    objects through the necessity of predicting their effects on
    the agent's own body. That is, the model learns holistic
    persistent representations of objects in the world, even

    The networks allow for efficient inference via optimization over some
    inputs to the network given others, and can be applied to settings
    including structured prediction, data imputation, reinforcement
    learning, and others. In this paper we lay the basic groundwork for
    these models, proposing methods for inference, optimization and
    learning, and analyze their representational power. We show that many
    existing neural network architectures can be made input-convex with
    a minor modification, and develop specialized optimization
    algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally, we highlight the
    performance of the methods on multi-label prediction, image
    completion, and reinforcement learning problems, where we show
    improvement over the existing state of the art in many cases.

    As machine learning techniques have become more ubiquitous, it has
    become common to see machine learning prediction algorithms operating
    within some larger process. However, the criteria by which we train
    machine learning algorithms often differ from the ultimate criteria on
    which we evaluate them. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for
    learning probabilistic machine learning models within the context of
    stochastic programming, in a manner that directly captures the
    ultimate task-based objective for which they will be used. We then
    present two experimental evaluations of the proposed approach, one as
    applied to a generic inventory stock problem and the second to a
    real-world electrical grid scheduling task. In both cases, we show
    that the proposed approach can outperform both a traditional modeling
    approach and a purely black-box policy optimization approach.

    Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are probabilistic inference machines that admit
    exact inference in linear time in the size of the network. Existing
    parameter learning approaches for SPNs are largely based on the maximum
    likelihood principle and hence are subject to overfitting compared to
    more Bayesian approaches. Exact Bayesian posterior inference for SPNs is
    computationally intractable. Both standard variational inference and
    posterior sampling for SPNs are computationally infeasible even for
    networks of moderate size due to the large number of local latent
    variables per instance. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic
    collapsed variational inference algorithm for SPNs that is
    computationally efficient, easy to implement and at the same time allows
    us to incorporate prior information into the optimization formulation.
    Extensive experiments show a significant improvement in accuracy compared
    with a maximum likelihood based approach.

Parameter estimation in discrete or continuous deterministic cell
cycle models is challenging for several reasons,
including the nature of what can be observed, and
the accuracy and quantity of those observations. The
challenge is even greater for stochastic models,
where the number of simulations and amount of
empirical data must be even larger to obtain
statistically valid parameter estimates. The two
main contributions of this work are (1) stochastic
model parameter estimation based on directly
matching multivariate probability distributions, and
(2) a new quasi-Newton algorithm class QNSTOP for
stochastic optimization problems. QNSTOP directly
uses the random objective function value samples
rather than creating ensemble statistics. QNSTOP is
used here to directly match empirical and simulated
joint probability distributions rather than matching
summary statistics. Results are given for a current
state-of-the-art stochastic cell cycle model of
budding yeast, whose predictions match well some
summary statistics and one-dimensional distributions
from empirical data, but do not match well the
empirical joint distributions. The nature of the
mismatch provides insight into the weakness in the
stochastic model.

    Unease over data privacy will retard consumer acceptance of IoT

    and dynamically enforces the current privacy policies of the owners

    a logical point of presence for mediators within the administrative

A fundamental challenge in imperfect-information games is that states do not have well-defined values. As a result, depth-limited search algorithms used in single-agent settings and perfect-information games do not apply. This paper introduces a principled way to conduct depth-limited solving in imperfect-information games by allowing the opponent to choose among a number of strategies for the remainder of the game at the depth limit. Each one of these strategies results in a different set of values for leaf nodes. This forces an agent to be robust to the different strategies an opponent may employ. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by building a master-level heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker AI that defeats two prior top agents using only a 4-core CPU and 16 GB of memory. Developing such a powerful agent would have previously required a supercomputer.
