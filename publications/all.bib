  abstract={
    Cameras are becoming ubiquitous in the Internet of Things (IoT) and
    can use face recognition technology to improve context. There is a
    large accuracy gap between today's publicly available face recognition
    systems and the state-of-the-art private face recognition
    systems. This paper presents our OpenFace face recognition library
    that bridges this accuracy gap. We show that OpenFace provides
    near-human accuracy on the LFW benchmark and present a new
    classification benchmark for mobile scenarios. This paper is intended
    for non-experts interested in using OpenFace and provides a light
    introduction to the deep neural network techniques we use.

        Model-based reinforcement learning approaches add explicit domain
        knowledge to agents in hopes of improving the
        sample-efficiency in comparison to model-free
        agents. However, in practice model-based methods are
        unable to achieve the same asymptotic performance on
        challenging continuous control tasks due to the
        complexity of learning and controlling an explicit
        world model. In this paper we investigate the
        stochastic value gradient (SVG), which is a
        well-known family of methods for controlling
        continuous systems which includes model-based
        approaches that distill a model-based value
        expansion into a model-free policy. We consider a
        variant of the model-based SVG that scales to larger
        systems and uses 1) an entropy regularization to
        help with exploration, 2) a learned deterministic
        world model to improve the short-horizon value
        estimate, and 3) a learned model-free value estimate
        after the model's rollout. This SVG variation
        captures the model-free soft actor-critic method as
        an instance when the model rollout horizon is zero,
        and otherwise uses short-horizon model rollouts to
        improve the value estimate for the policy update. We
        surpass the asymptotic performance of other
        model-based methods on the proprioceptive MuJoCo
        locomotion tasks from the OpenAI gym, including a
        humanoid. We notably achieve these results with a
        simple deterministic world model without requiring

        Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a useful method for aligning, comparing

    Training an agent to solve control tasks directly from
    high-dimensional images with model-free
    reinforcement learning (RL) has proven
    difficult. The agent needs to learn a latent
    representation together with a control policy to
    perform the task. Fitting a high-capacity encoder
    using a scarce reward signal is not only sample
    inefficient, but also prone to suboptimal
    convergence. Two ways to improve sample efficiency
    are to extract relevant features for the task and
    use off-policy algorithms. We dissect various
    approaches of learning good latent features, and
    conclude that the image reconstruction loss is the
    essential ingredient that enables efficient and
    stable representation learning in image-based
    RL. Following these findings, we devise an
    off-policy actor-critic algorithm with an auxiliary
    decoder that trains end-to-end and matches
    state-of-the-art performance across both model-free

  abstract={
  Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been shown to be a powerful framework for data-efficiently learning control of continuous tasks. Recent work in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced function approximators and planning schemes, with little development of the general framework. In this paper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework--what we call the objective mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics model wrt the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control task. For example, this issue can emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate models might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of one-step ahead predictions is not always correlated with control performance. This observation highlights a critical limitation in the MBRL framework which will require further research to be fully understood and addressed. We propose an initial method to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics model training. Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential directions of research for addressing this issue.

    Recent work has shown how to embed differentiable optimization problems (that is, problems whose solutions can be backpropagated through) as layers within deep learning architectures. This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver’s solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.

    We consider the setting of an agent with a fixed body interacting with an

    In spite of being trained with only internally available
    signals, these dynamic body models come to represent external
    objects through the necessity of predicting their effects on
    the agent's own body. That is, the model learns holistic
    persistent representations of objects in the world, even
    though the only training signals are body signals. Our
    dynamics model is able to successfully predict distributions
    over 132 sensor readings over 100 steps into the future and we

    with an object, the latent variables of the dynamics model
    continue to represent its shape. We show that active data

    we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast
    GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which
    provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of
    the solve;
    and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems.
    In one notable example, we show that the method is

    these models, proposing methods for inference, optimization and
    learning, and analyze their representational power. We show that many
    existing neural network architectures can be made input-convex with
    a minor modification, and develop specialized optimization
    algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally, we highlight the
    performance of the methods on multi-label prediction, image
    completion, and reinforcement learning problems, where we show
    improvement over the existing state of the art in many cases.

  abstract={
    As machine learning techniques have become more ubiquitous, it has
    become common to see machine learning prediction algorithms operating
    within some larger process. However, the criteria by which we train
    machine learning algorithms often differ from the ultimate criteria on
    which we evaluate them. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for
    learning probabilistic machine learning models within the context of
    stochastic programming, in a manner that directly captures the
    ultimate task-based objective for which they will be used. We then
    present two experimental evaluations of the proposed approach, one as
    applied to a generic inventory stock problem and the second to a
    real-world electrical grid scheduling task. In both cases, we show
    that the proposed approach can outperform both a traditional modeling
    approach and a purely black-box policy optimization approach.

  abstract={
    Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are probabilistic inference machines that admit
    exact inference in linear time in the size of the network. Existing
    parameter learning approaches for SPNs are largely based on the maximum
    likelihood principle and hence are subject to overfitting compared to
    more Bayesian approaches. Exact Bayesian posterior inference for SPNs is
    computationally intractable. Both standard variational inference and
    posterior sampling for SPNs are computationally infeasible even for
    networks of moderate size due to the large number of local latent
    variables per instance. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic
    collapsed variational inference algorithm for SPNs that is
    computationally efficient, easy to implement and at the same time allows
    us to incorporate prior information into the optimization formulation.
    Extensive experiments show a significant improvement in accuracy compared
    with a maximum likelihood based approach.

    Unease over data privacy will retard consumer acceptance of IoT
    deployments. The primary source of discomfort is a lack of user
    control over raw data that is streamed directly from sensors to the
    cloud. This is a direct consequence of the over-centralization of
    today’s cloud-based IoT hub designs. We propose a solution that
    interposes a locally-controlled software component called a privacy
    mediator on every raw sensor stream. Each mediator is in the same
    administrative domain as the sensors whose data is being collected,
    and dynamically enforces the current privacy policies of the owners
    of the sensors or mobile users within the domain. This solution necessitates
    a logical point of presence for mediators within the administrative
    boundaries of each organization. Such points of presence
    are provided by cloudlets, which are small locally-administered data
    centers at the edge of the Internet that can support code mobility.
    The use of cloudlet-based mediators aligns well with natural personal
    and organizational boundaries of trust and responsibility.

    provides a probabilistic way of modeling multi-label predictions

    optimize the top-k recall for multi-label tasks with incomplete label
    information. We evaluate LML layers on top-k CIFAR-100 classification
    and scene graph generation. We show that LML layers add a negligible
    amount of computational overhead, strictly improve the model's
    representational capacity, and improve accuracy. We also revisit the
    truncated top-k entropy method as a competitive baseline for top-k
    classification.

A fundamental challenge in imperfect-information games is that states do not have well-defined values. As a result, depth-limited search algorithms used in single-agent settings and perfect-information games do not apply. This paper introduces a principled way to conduct depth-limited solving in imperfect-information games by allowing the opponent to choose among a number of strategies for the remainder of the game at the depth limit. Each one of these strategies results in a different set of values for leaf nodes. This forces an agent to be robust to the different strategies an opponent may employ. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by building a master-level heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker AI that defeats two prior top agents using only a 4-core CPU and 16 GB of memory. Developing such a powerful agent would have previously required a supercomputer.
